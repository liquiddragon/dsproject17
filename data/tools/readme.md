# Tools used

Here are tools used to obtain processed outputs, if necessary.

## FAO crops
Use these two scripts in same directory where you have CSV files from Production_Crops_E_All_Data.zip and Production_Crops_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip extacted. They will produce one file per item and per element such as 'wheat-seed.csv'. Both scripts use Python 3 and expect to have Pandas available.
* production_crops_all_process.py
* production_crops_normalized_all_process.py
